The file GL.cs cannot be compiled unless the following definition is at the
beginning of that file:

    #define ENABLE_GL_CODE
    
If that definition is contained within a comment, i.e.,

    //#define ENABLE_GL_CODE
    
then you must remove the comment prefix (i.e., "//") to enable that definition.


If you are using Microsoft Visual C# 2008/2005/2003, or Microsoft Visual C# 
2008/2005/2003 Express Edition, or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008/2005/2003, or 
possibly the 2010 version of one of those editors, then it is likely that 
your editor will become totally unresponsive for 10 seconds, and then become 
usable for a few seconds before becoming unresponsive for another 10 seconds,
repeating that pattern indefinitely -- unless you temporarily disable the 
definition specified above.  The problem is that IntelliSense is repeatedly 
analyzing thousands of lines of code that haven't changed, and that, for some
reason, the code analysis blocks the editor itself from working!  The only 
practical solution is to simply disable the code while editing, by disabling the 
definition specified above, and then enable that definition only when ready to 
compile the code.

If you are not using a Microsoft code editor, then you can enable that 
definition permanently.
